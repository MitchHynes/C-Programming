C programming I do as I work through K&R's C Programming book. My main intention is to develop the necessary C skills for Kaiwan Billimoria's
"Hands on System Programming with Linux". 

Projects I think of doing as I work through the book I will list here:

1. Create an addition to the printf(1) function to display an unsigned integer in binary format.
When I worked through some chapter 2 exercies, I needed an external decimal to binary converter when I was testing the functions, or else I
would have had to create a decimal to binary converter function. It would be nice if print had an identifier specifically for this,
such as printf("%b\n",3) which returns 0000 0011.
